    Debugging sayHello function
    The starship Enterprise has run into some problem when creating a program to greet everyone as they come aboard.
    It is your job to fix the code and get the program working again!

    Example output:
    Hello, Mr. Spock
</p>
<script>
    console.log('solution')

    function sayHello(name) {
        return `Hello, ${name}`;
    }

    console.log(sayHello('Iuliia'))
</script>
