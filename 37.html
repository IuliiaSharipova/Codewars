    What if we need the length of the words separated by a space to be added at the end of that same word and have it
    returned as an array?

    Example(Input --> Output)

    "apple ban" --> ["apple 5", "ban 3"]
    "you will win" -->["you 3", "will 4", "win 3"]
    Your task is to write a function that takes a String and returns an Array/list with the length of each word added to
    each element .

    Note: String will have at least one element; words will always be separated by a space.

        let arrWithLength = []

            let wordLength = arrWithoutLength[i].length
            arrWithLength.push(`${arrWithoutLength[i]} ${wordLength}`)
        }
        return arrWithLength
    }*/
    const addLength = (str) => str.split(" ").map(el => `${el} ${el.length}`)
    console.log(addLength('I am smart'))
    console.log(addLength('apple ban'))
