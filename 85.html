    You will be given a list of strings. You must sort it alphabetically (case-sensitive, and based on the ASCII values
    of the chars) and then return the first value.
    The returned value must be a string, and have "***" between each of its letters.
    You should not remove or add elements from/to the array.

    function twoSort(s) {
        return s.sort()[0].split('').join('***')
    }

    console.log(twoSort(arr))
