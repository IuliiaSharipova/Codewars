    You are given an array with positive numbers and a non-negative number N. You should find the N-th power of the
    element in the array with the index N. If N is outside of the array, then return -1. Don't forget that the first
    element has the index 0.

    Let's look at a few examples:
    array = [1, 2, 3, 4] and N = 2, then the result is 3^2 == 9;
    array = [1, 2, 3] and N = 3, but N is outside of the array, so the result is -1.

    console.log('solution')

    const index=(array, n)=> n <array.length ? Math.pow(array[n], n) : -1

    console.log(index([1, 2, 3], 3))
    console.log(index([1, 2, 3, 4], 2))
