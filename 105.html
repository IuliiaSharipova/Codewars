    <title>105 Total amount of points</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>
    Our football team has finished the championship.
    Our team's match results are recorded in a collection of strings. Each match is represented by a string in the
    format "x:y", where x is our team's score and y is our opponents score.

    For example: ["3:1", "2:2", "0:1", ...]
    Points are awarded for each match as follows:
    if x > y: 3 points (win)
    if x < y: 0 points (loss)
    if x = y: 1 point (tie)
    We need to write a function that takes this collection and returns the number of points our team (x) got in the
    championship by the rules given above.

    Notes:
    our team always plays 10 matches in the championship
    0 <= x <= 4
    0 <= y <= 4

            if (arr[i][0] > arr[i][1]) {
                count += 3
            } else if (+arr[i][0] === +arr[i][1]) {
                count += 1
            } else {
                count += 0
