<p>
    Timmy & Sarah think they are in love, but around where they live, they will only know once they pick a flower each.
    If one of the flowers has an even number of petals and the other has an odd number of petals it means they are in
    love.

    Write a function that will take the number of petals of each flower and return true if they are in love and false if
    they aren't.

    console.log('solution')

    function lovefunc(flower1, flower2) {
        return ((flower1 + flower2) % 2 !== 0)
    }

    console.log(lovefunc(1, 4))
    console.log(lovefunc(0, 0))
    //Test:
    /*const chai = require("chai");
    const assert = chai.assert;
    chai.config.truncateThreshold = 0;

    describe("Basic tests", () => {
        it("Testing for fixed tests", () => {
            assert.strictEqual(lovefunc(1, 4), true)

            assert.strictEqual(lovefunc(0, 1), true)
