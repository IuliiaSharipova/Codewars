    I have a cat and a dog.
    I got them at the same time as kitten/puppy. That was humanYears years ago.
    Return their respective ages now as [humanYears,catYears,dogYears]

    NOTES:

    humanYears >= 1
    humanYears are whole numbers only

    Cat Years
    15 cat years for first year
    +9 cat years for second year
    +4 cat years for each year after that

    Dog Years
    15 dog years for first year
    +9 dog years for second year
    +5 dog years for each year after that
