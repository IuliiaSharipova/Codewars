    You will be given a sequence of objects representing data about developers who have signed up to attend the next
    coding meetup that you are organising.

    Your task is to return a sequence which includes the developer who is the oldest. In case of a tie, include all
    same-age senior developers listed in the same order as they appeared in the original input array.

    Notes:
    The input array will always be valid and formatted as in the example above and will never be empty.
