    <title>106 Sentence Smash</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>
    Write a function that takes an array of words and smashes them together into a sentence and returns the sentence.
    You can ignore any need to sanitize words or add punctuation, but you should add spaces between each word. Be
    careful, there shouldn't be a space at the beginning or the end of the sentence!

    Example:
    ['hello', 'world', 'this', 'is', 'great'] => 'hello world this is great'
</p>
</body>
</html>


<script>
    console.log('solution')
    function smash (words) {
        return words.join(' ')
    };
    console.log(smash(["hello", "amazing", "world"]))
</script>
