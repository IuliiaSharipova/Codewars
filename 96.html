<p>
    Leo's girlfriend asked him to buy a gift list during his next trip, now he wants to know how many of them will he be
    able to buy.

    Write a function to help Leo out. The first parameter of the function is Leo's budget; the second one is an array
    containing the price of each gift. You should return an integer representing the maximum amount of gifts Leo can
    buy.

    Example:
    Maximum budget: 20
    Gift List: [13, 2, 4, 6, 1]
    Should return 4.

    NOTE: All numbers will be integers >= 0, and the array will never be empty.

<script>
    console.log('solution')

    function howManyGifts(maxBudget, gifts) {
        gifts.sort((a, b) => a - b)
        return gifts.filter(item => (maxBudget -= item) >= 0).length
    }

    console.log(howManyGifts(20, [13, 2, 4, 6, 1]))//4
    console.log(howManyGifts(0, [1]))//0
</script>
