<body>
<p>
    Find the mean (average) of a list of numbers in an array.
    Information:
    To find the mean (average) of a set of numbers add all of the numbers together and divide by the number of values in
    the list.
    For an example list of 1, 3, 5, 7:
    1. Add all of the numbers: 1+3+5+7 = 16
    2. Divide by the number of values in the list. In this example there are 4 numbers in the list.
    16/4 = 4
    3. The mean (or average) of this list is 4.

    console.log('solution')
    const findAverage = function (nums) {
        return nums.reduce((acc, el) => acc + el, 0) / nums.length
    }
    console.log(findAverage([1, 3, 5, 7]))
